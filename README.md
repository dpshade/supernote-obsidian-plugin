- Close other applications to free up system resources
- Consider processing files in smaller batches for very large collections

## Development

### Building from Source
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Building Directly to Obsidian Vault
For development and testing, you can build the plugin directly to your Obsidian vault:

```bash
# One-time build to vault
npm run build-to-vault "C:\Users\username\Documents\MyVault"

# Development mode with auto-rebuild on changes
npm run dev-to-vault "C:\Users\username\Documents\MyVault"
```

**Usage:**
- Replace the path with your actual Obsidian vault path
- Use quotes around the path if it contains spaces
- The plugin will be installed to `.obsidian/plugins/supernote-obsidian-plugin/`
- After installation, disable and re-enable the plugin in Obsidian settings

**Development Workflow:**
1. Run `npm run dev-to-vault <vault-path>` 
2. Make changes to the source code
3. Files are automatically built and copied to your vault
4. Reload the plugin in Obsidian to see changes

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```

## FAQ

**Q** Why isn't there a table of contents in the generated Markdown file? 

**A** Because the [Obsidian Outline](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Outline) sidebar accomplishes this same feature.
